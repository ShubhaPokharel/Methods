# Methods

Dont write all your coding inside the main method. You can define your own method which is called user defined method.

- Method is used to write the logics of the application.

## Types of Methods:

### Static Method

If we use the the static modifier in the method, it is called static method. We can acess the static method by using the class name. 



### Instance Method

If we dont use the static modifier in a method, it is called instance method. To acess an instance method we create the object at first and we call that instance method by using that object name.


JVM only knows the main method.In coding main method executes first. So, we have to call user defined  methods inside the main method.
